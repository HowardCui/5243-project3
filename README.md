## How to Use

### Getting Started

The app randomly assigns you to **Version A** or **Version B** upon first visit via the redirect entry point. Both versions support the same core workflow: upload or select a dataset, explore it visually, and generate charts.

---

### Step 1 — Load Your Data

**Version A**
1. Navigate to the **Data Upload** tab
2. Choose a data source:
   - **Sample dataset** — select from the dropdown (Penguins, Cars, College)
   - **Upload a file** — click the file input and select a `.csv` file from your machine
3. Wait for the status indicator to show a success state

**Version B**
1. Check the **User Guide** tab for a quick walkthrough (optional)
2. Navigate to the **Data Upload** tab
3. Select a sample dataset from the dropdown **or** upload a `.csv` file
4. Wait for the status indicator to confirm the data loaded successfully

> If loading fails, check that your file is a valid `.csv` with a header row and try again.

---

### Step 2 — Review the Data Summary

Once data is loaded, a summary table will appear automatically showing column types, basic statistics, and a preview of the dataset. Review this before proceeding to make sure the right data was loaded.

---

### Step 3 — Generate a Visualization

1. Navigate to the **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA) tab
2. Select a **plot type**:

   | Plot Type | Description | Available In |
   |---|---|---|
   | Scatter | X vs Y relationship | A, B |
   | Histogram | Distribution of one variable | A, B |
   | Box | Distribution by group | A, B |
   | Bar | Category counts or means | A, B |
   | Correlation Heatmap | Pairwise correlations | B only |

3. Select the variable(s) for the axes
4. Click **Generate Plot**

> A plot will only render if the selected variables contain valid, non-empty data after removing missing values.

---

### Step 4 — Export (Version B only)

Navigate to the **Export** tab to download the current chart or summary as a file.

---

### Sample Datasets

| Dataset | Description |
|---|---|
| `penguins.csv` | Palmer Penguins — species, island, bill/flipper measurements |
| `cars.json` | Car attributes and performance metrics |
| `College.rds` | US College statistics (from ISLR) |
